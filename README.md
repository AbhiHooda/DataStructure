# DataStructure
A guide to data structure 

## What Is A Data Structure
It doesn’t start without asking: What the heck data structure is?
* It’s an intentional arrangement of a collection of data that we’ve built.

### Intentional Arrangement
The intentional arrangement means the arrangement done on purpose to impose, to enforce, some kind of systematic organization on the data.
Because it’s useful, it makes our lives easier, and it’s easy to manage when you keep related information together.


##  Data Structures In our Life
We need data structures in our programs because we think this way as human beings.
A recipe is an actual data structure, as is a shopping list, a telephone directory, a dictionary, etc. They all have a structure, they have a format.
Let’s say you are to find a specific book in an unorganized library, that task would take an enormous amount of time. Just like a library organizes their books, we need to organize our data so that operations can be performed efficiently.

### Data Structure and Object Oriented Programming
Now if you’re an object oriented programmer, you may be thinking, Well isn’t this what we do with classes and objects?.
I mean, we define these real-world objects in a program because we think this way as human being, or at least we’re supposed to.
And yes, absolutely. Objects are a type of data structure, and not the only one.

### Five Fundamental Behaviors
How to access, insert, delete, find, & sort. These are the operations that you will most likely going to perform.
Not all of data structures have the five fundamental behaviors (perform these operations efficiently), that’s what led to the development of different data structures. 
For example, many data structures don’t support any kind of searching behavior, It’s just a big collection, a big container of stuff, and If you need to find something, you just go through all of it yourself. And many don’t provide any kind of sorting behavior. Others are naturally sorted.
Each data structure has it’s own different way, or different algorithm for sorting, inserting, finding, …etc, Why? Because, due to the nature of the data structure, there are algorithms used with specific data structure, where some other can’t be used.
The more efficient & suitable the algorithm, the more you will have an optimized data structure. These algorithms might be built-in or implemented by developer to manage and run these data structures.
***
> Always read the language documentation and check the performance of the algorithms used with the underlying data structure. Different algorithms might be used based on the data (it’s size, type, …) you have.
